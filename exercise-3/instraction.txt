Your task

1) Create a new type / data structure for storing product data (e.g about a book)
    The data structure should contain these fields:
    - ID
    - Title
    - Short description
    - price (number without currency, we'll just assume USD)

2) Create concrete instance of this data type in two different ways:
    - Directly inside of the main function 
    - Inside of main, by using a "creation helper function"
    (use any values for Title etc. of your choice)
    Output (print) the created data structure in the command line (in the main function)

3) Add a "connected function" that outputs of the data + call that function from Inside "main function"

4) Change the programm to fetch user input values for the different data fields 
    and create only one concrete instance with that entered data.
    Output that instance data (via the connected function) then.

5) Bonus: Add a connected "store" function that writes that data into a file.
    The file name should be the unique id the function should be called at the end of main.
